# BackDroid

This repository contains the source code of BackDroid, a search-based Android static analysis tool with much better performance than Amandroid and FlowDroid.
It is a research output from our DSN'21 paper entitled "When Program Analysis Meets Bytecode Search: Targeted and Efficient Inter-procedural Analysis of Modern Android Apps in BackDroid".

The BackDroid code is currently hosted in a private BitBucket repo, and we will migrate it to GitHub before the conference of DSN'21 in June 2021.
